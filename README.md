# TibaRepoSearch

## Background

This is a solution for TIBA candidacy assignment. 

The goal of this project is to create a web application that allows users to search for and favor GitHub repositories.

## Design Issues
1. The assignment specifies a 202 status for the POST /api/favorites endpoint. This is ambiguous because a 202 status typically indicates that a request has been accepted for processing but not yet completed. However, in this case, the operation of adding a favorite repository is expected to be completed immediately. Therefore, a more appropriate status code would be 201 (Created) to indicate that the resource has been successfully created.
2. The assignment suggested requests are missing a user ID, hinting identification of the user by the Authorization header within per-user operations. However, the Authorization header is typically used for authentication purposes rather than user identification. A more suitable approach would be to include a user ID in the request body or as a query parameter to clearly identify the user performing the operation.

## Design Decisions
1. Command pattern for use cases, for easier business logic invocation
